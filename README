woat/dotfiles

Configuration files to reduce friction across machines. These files were revealed from the cosmos after direct communication with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Using these files will allow the user to leave humanity behind and ascend to enlightenment.

.vimrc - Reduces latency from natural cognitive inhibitors to accelerate throughput.
.zshrc - Z.
.tmux.conf - Terminal multiplexer adjusted for ascended beings.
commands - Things that the MIB frequently erase from my biological hard drive.
